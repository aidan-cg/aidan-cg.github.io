I'm a 2nd year PhD student at Duke University in the Statistical Science department. I work on statistical and machine learning methodology for complex data, where difficulties arise from interactions between observational units. Examples include network analysis (social, epidemiological) and computation biology (immunolgy, protein folding). 

These problems often result in high-dimensional parameter spaces, requiring accurate and efficient inference algorithms. Given that I typically take a Bayesian approach, my research thus involves the design and analysis of sampling algorithms such as sequential Monte carlo or adaptive MCMC methods. 

Before arriving at Duke, I worked as a Senior Research Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I helped develop SMC.jl and DSGE.jl, Julia packages used to estimate large state-space models using sequential Monte Carlo. 

Outside of research, I enjoy backpacking, reading, and running.
